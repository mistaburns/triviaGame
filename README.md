Here I used a simple interval timer for the Game. I used classes to designate correct and incorrect answers. On click of .correct the score 
increments by 1. 

I will come back to this because I'd like to tweak the CSS for better alignment, I also plan on adding CSS through JS that clearly indicates 
that a button has been clicked.
